#linux-surfacebook
A kernel which strives to be semi-practical for daily use on the Surface Book, no matter the cost (stability included)

Forked from Arsalan's linux surfacebook changes and incoporates zen patches.

Currently must run makepkg with the --skipint flag because SHA-256 sums are not configured correctly.

Also credit to ilikenwf on AUR for providing the makefile for zen kernal
